# Digital Clock

This is a simple yet elegant digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM, updating every second.

## Features

- Displays the current time in the format `HH : MM : SS AM/PM`.
- Automatically updates every second using JavaScript.
- Uses a background image for a visually appealing design.
- Fully responsive for mobile and desktop views.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Technology Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the clock and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Used to dynamically update the time every second.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock adjusts its size based on screen width.
- **Background Image**: Adds a professional touch to the design.

## How It Works

1. The HTML file contains a `div` element that holds the clock (`#time`).
2. The JavaScript function `displayTime()` fetches the current time using the `Date` object and formats it to 12-hour format.
3. The time is displayed in the `#time` element, and the `setInterval()` method ensures the time is updated every second.
4. The CSS styles the clock, centers it on the screen, and makes it responsive for smaller screens.
5. The clockâ€™s background is set with an image for a visually appealing design.
